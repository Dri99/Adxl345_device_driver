Kenrel panics because we didn't give it a root fs which is needed to find /sbin/init

not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

Problem after running in section busybox:

make 

make install

as make install will try to install busybox on host machine. 
Note: maybe it is a good idea as it will create the required files for next part. Maybe it is bette to mention it in TP text
Solution: it was actually a problem related to how my hard drive was mounted

Some problems executing:
10. With U-Boot, load the files in memory 

As I was expecting an automatic load from U-Boot, while commands whould have been written by myself

The only dts containing "adxl345@53" is ./arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga_cyclone5_de0_nano_soc.dts , but we don't compile that, but vexpress-v2p-ca9.dts

first compile failed for missing return, added return 0

Tp2.5 modified command to run the actual project, in particular the -initrd and -kernel
Boots correctly
.6 nothing writes

.7

added the device at the bottom of the dts of vexpress-v2p-ca9.dts

recompile the dtb

Apparently now the driver is loaded
